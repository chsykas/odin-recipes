    <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
    <p>
      In the mecca of confectionery, Paris, a famous dessert that has been
      driving young and old crazy for years now is the eclair.Its appearance in
      confectionery comes from the 16th century, when the Italian cook of
      Catherine de Medici, Popellini, prepared its characteristic dough.Its
      final form was acquired by Antonin Careme, a well-known chef of the 19th
      century, who filled the eclairs with pastry cream
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret to the success of the "Duchess bread" as it used to be called,
      lies in the careful preparation of its fluffy golden dough that requires
      three different stages for a fluffy result. Its soft and velvety cream is
      based on an old recipe from the 17th century, while the glaze that covers
      its crispy surface gives it a unique shine that catches the eye from the
      first moment.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <span>For the cream</span>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put 400gr milk in a saucepan, the half sugar, the vanilla and transfer
        to medium heat. Let it heat up and bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the egg yolks, the rest of the sugar in a bowl and mix with a hand
        whisk to dissolve the sugar. Add the remaining milk, corn flour, salt
        and mix well to homogenize the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the milk has boiled, very slowly transfer it to the bowl with the
        eggs, stirring constantly so that the eggs do not burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put all the mixture from the bowl back into the saucepan over medium
        heat and stir constantly, until the cream thickens and comes to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pot from the heat and add the butter, the milk couverture in
        pieces and mix well with the hand whisk until the ingredients are melted
        and homogenized.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the cream to a bowl and cover with cling film. Make sure that
        the film touches the surface of the cream so that it does not form a
        crust. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool.
      </li>
    </ol>
      <span>For the sous</span>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 170°C on the resistances.</li>
        <li>
          Put the water, milk, butter, salt, sugar, vanilla in a saucepan and
          bring to medium to high heat. Mix with a spoon and let it come to a
          boil and homogenize the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the mixture comes to a boil, add the flour and mix with a spoon.
          Cook the dough for 2-3 minutes so that it loses its moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the dough to the mixer bowl and beat with the wire at high
          speed for 2-3 minutes to lower its temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the eggs one by one until you have a soft dough. The number of
          eggs we put depends on how well we baked the dough and how much
          moisture evaporated. The more egg the dough gets, the better yours
          will turn out.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer to a piping bag with a star tip and set aside.</li>
        <li>
          We spread greaseproof paper on a baking sheet and make sure to put
          some of the dough in between so that they stick together and don't
          come off during baking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut the dough into 5 cm strips. In total, we will need 2 pans. Spread
          oil spray or sunflower oil on their surface, sprinkle with powdered
          sugar and bake for 25 minutes. Then lower the oven to 150°C on the
          resistances and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, once the baking time is over, we can leave sous in the
          oven with the door open. Let them cool well.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <span>For the composition</span>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix the pastry cream very well with a whisk or hand whisk to make it frothy and transfer to a pastry bag with a round tip.</li>
        <li>Fill sous with the cream from the bottom side.</li>
        <li>Put the melted milk couverture in a bowl and dip the upper side of sous.</li>
        <li>Serve with almond fillet.</li>
